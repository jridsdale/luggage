You'll probably want to replace hook_background.jpg with something
appropriate for your environment.

You need to download a copy of iHook from 

http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/ihook/ 

since my hook driver scripts rely on it to present a pretty dialog
with a progress bar during login & logout as they run the appropriate
hook scripts.

Tar it up, then bzip2 the tarball.
